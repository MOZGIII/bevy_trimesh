# bevy_trimesh

`TriMesh` support for `bevy`.

`TriMesh` here is as in the `rapier3d` and `parry3d` family of crates, but
the resulting generated `TriMesh` is raw and is technically agnostic to
the glue code that integrates `rapier3d` into `bevy` - that is, it should work
with both `bevy_rapier3d` and `heron`.

See generated docs for more info.
